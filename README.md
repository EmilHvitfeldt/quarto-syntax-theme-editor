This repository is a small playground set up for you to manually modify a `.theme` file used for syntax highlighting.

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) allows for [custom syntax highlighting](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-code.html#custom-highlighting). The repository provided a minimal project for you to more easily modify a theme.

The themes are based on KDE syntax highlighting descriptions and are described at <https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/kate/katepart/color-themes.html>. I find that using my browsers Developer Tools to inspect the different elements to find out what "class" each code element is to a fruitful strategy.

# Usage

Fork/download this repository, modify the `custom.theme` and re-render `index.qmd`. Repeat as necessary.

# Contribution

If you have suggestions, regarding languages, modifications of code to better show highlighting themes, or ways to make this process easier. Please open an issue!
